            <p>Now you may question yourself if the whole universe is also a part of the frontrooms. No one knows the answer to that yet, since only very small part of it has been discovered, and also, we still don't know if the backrooms are existent in this universe or in a completely other dimension that has nothing to do with this one.</p>
            <p>Difficulty: may vary</p>
            <p>Species of entities (animals): at least 1.2 million</p>
